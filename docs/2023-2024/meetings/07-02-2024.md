### Present at the meeting

`@eli`, `@karim`, `@sander` and `@luis`

## Go over action points from last meeting

### `@sander` Discuss with Marije what are the agreements with the agencies and if/how we can keep them to this agreement

There seemed to have been a mix-up in the assignments of the agencies to the students. The internal documents the staff was using was not up-to-date. This has been fixed and the students have been informed about the changes.

### `@sander` Validate how graduation with distinction works and see if the system can be made more transparent

`@marije` is looking into this. Any follow-up will be shared.

:::warning[Action point]
Keep the OC and students informed about the progress.

## Reflection on the assessment

### Any feedback from the students?

### "robust concepts" or "the (mis)use of LLM in student work" with `@luis`

Concerns have been raised from the staff members on the abundant use of LLMs in student work without proper citation. As stated in the [AI policy of the HvA](https://www.hva.nl/bibliotheek/ondersteuning/zoeken/bronnen-vermelden/ai-gegenereerde-content/ai-gegenereerde-content.html) (in Dutch), students are not allowed to use AI tools to generate work without proper citation. This includes the use of LLMs to generate the content, such as images and text, of their portfolios.

:::danger
The lack of proper citation could lead to (unintended) plagiarism which could have serious consequences for the student.
:::

The staff members are looking into how to make this more explicit in the assessment documents.

:::info[Ethical dilemma]
If students hand in AI generated portfolios, would it be acceptable for the MDD staff to use AI tools to grade and give feedback?
