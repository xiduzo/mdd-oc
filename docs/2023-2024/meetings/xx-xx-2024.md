#### `@sander` Discuss with the teaching staff how we can make sure the schedule is more clear and in advance for the students

#### `@sander` Discuss with the program director on how we can make sure students can get a numerical grade instead or besides of a pass-fail grade.

#### `@sander` Share more about the goal of the DOJOs to the students

Put an explanation in the general teams channel about the goal of the DOJOs and how they can be used by the students. The students responded by providing some feedback on the DOJOs and made: [Dojos and sessions requests](/files/Dojos-and-sessions-requests.pdf)
