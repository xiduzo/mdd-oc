Things pointed out by students:  The foundations week took longer than promoted (2 months instead of 1)Not all students will be working directly with the partner agencies, it depends on the briefs provided in the playgrounds Some students explicitly apply to this program to have the opportunity to work with partner agencies and create a network within the Netherlands after the program.

However, some students have part-time jobs or other obligations that require them to be available at certain times.  Having a fixed schedule for the MDD is not always possible, but the MDD should try to make more effort into scheduling the program as much in advance as possible so students can plan ahead. Advice for the current year is to schedule the program at least 1 month (4 school weeks) in advance. For the next year, the MDD should have a more clear schedule for the entire year students can rely upon.  Action point Discuss with the teaching staff how we can make sure the schedule is more clear and in advance for the students.

This is because the pass-fail system does not provide a GPA, which is often a requirement for these programs.  Besides the future, some students are afraid that within a pass-fail system, the feedback they will receive won't be explicit enough on where they stand and how they can improve to achieve higher outcomes (read; better grades in a more traditional system).  As a final point, the range in the pass-fail system gives the students not enough feedback on &quot;how much&quot; they passed an assessment as a passing grade represents 50% of the spectrum.  Action point Discuss with the program director how we can make sure students can get a numerical grade instead of or besides a pass-fail grade.

This makes it hard for the students to prepare for the assessment(s) and they are not sure what to expect.  Students have also noticed they are getting contradicting advice from different mentors, especially on the personal project. This different advice would make sense in a 1-on-1 mentor session but this advice was given in a group setting.  The students are still unclear on how they will be assessed on the competencies and how they can prepare for this inside of their annotated portfolio. The shared competencies document (on the miro board) was shared as a draft over two months ago and has not been updated since.

However, as mentioned in scheduling, we need to make sure that the DOJOs are scheduled more in advance so students can have a fair chance to fit them into their schedules and attend them.  Students are in control of the DOJOS and if they can not attend a particular DOJO for whatever reason (eg, no more space in the DOJO or did not fit their schedule), they can always propose a new date and time.  One suggested DOJO from the students is UX design research. Questions the students have are:  what kind of jobs can I get with thishow does the day of a UX researcher look like  tip The MDD is stimulating students who have taken the DOJO to pass on their knowledge to the rest of the cohort (SDL!).

However, the choice of playground was a bit ambiguous as the students did not have the feeling they had enough information to make a well-informed decision.  This was mostly due to the fact the students would have liked to have known the briefs for the playground ahead of time so they would have a better understanding of what they would be working on.

Student input The students responded by providing some feedback on the DOJOs and made: Dojos and sessions requests  The document provided is lacking some direction and is not very clear on what the students want to learn:  Some DOJOs are way too broad (e.g; UX design) in scope and can be a full 2 year program by itself. As from the message put in teams: &quot;learning to code&quot; is a very broad topic, what do you want to learn? This can range from building apps, making websites, interactive art/installations, writing a Figma plugin, automating my house, working with open data, making prototypes interactiveSome DOJOs are random buzz words (e.g; Video Coaching) and lack focus on what the students want to learn. As from the message put in teams: What is important for a DOJO is to have a clear goal you want to learnSome DOJOs are already out there on brightspace and can be followed by the students themselves. Master students are expected to be pro-active in their learning process.Some DOJOs can be done by other facilities within the HvA. For example; the HvA has a 3D printing facility (the makers lab) where students can learn about 3D printing by the staff present.Some DOJOs are part of the curriculum and will be provided by the teaching staff. For example; User Research is part of the track angela is teaching.  Other DOJOs will be planned according to the document provided by the students. This document is shared among the teaching staff. The MDD will also reach out the partner agencies to see if they can provide a DOJO/workshop.  SDL Due to time constraints we will not be able to provide all requested DOJOs. The MDD is stimulating students who also are pro-active in learning about the topics they are interested in. This is a great opportunity for students to take the lead and organize a DOJO themselves.  note It is good to see DOJOs are being planned in and communicated more in advance.

The Dutch government announced changes to the management of international students and new financial regulations to the admissions process were added. As a result, international students were somewhat less than in previous years.  In 2022, MDD welcomed new leadership to the program, injecting fresh ideas and perspectives. With renewed direction and enthusiasm, this year was a year of restructuring and trying out new ideas for the curriculum, such as the introduction of a project ‘Afterlife’. These changes were met with challenges due to understaffing, but nevertheless the staff did their best to navigate these hurdles.  New AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, took the world by storm.

Concerns have been raised from the staff members on the abundant use of LLMs in student work without proper citation.

This includes the use of LLMs to generate the content, such as images and text, of their portfolios.  Getting expelled The lack of proper citation could lead to (unintended) plagiarism which could have serious consequences for the student.

We've interpreted the descriptions and assigned corresponding grades to each level as follows: Novice: 5Competent: 6.5Proficient: 8Visionary: 9 For each criterion, we awarded a grade and then calculated the average to determine the overall competence score. The final score for the assessment is the mean of these individual scores. Should a competence be failed, the highest possible average score cannot exceed 5.1. Previously, our method subtracted the number of competencies failed from 5, which we found overly punitive. To address this, we now calculate the genuine average, capping it at 5.1 to ensure fairness. It is listed in our TER that one should pass all competences.

We are grateful for your comments, which will help us improve the TER for future generations.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to implement all the suggested changes for next year. Some of the proposed modifications require changes to the format at a central level.  Below, I address the specific comments you provided.  Responses to Comments  2.6: Kiki suggested that we provide more details on counseling options. While we cannot change the text of the TER format, we will be mindful of this when compiling our studyguide.  3.1: Eli inquired about the inclusion of a behavioral assessment. Currently, we do not use this format in the MDD program, making it less relevant. This section contains standard text issued to all programs.  3.6: Kiki remarked that formative test should receive a numerical grade. These tests are intended to provide qualitative feedback, and the evaluation method is at the discretion of the evaluator. Partial tests are not being used currently.  4.1: Kiki commented on the policy regarding re-sits for higher grades. While the standard text cannot be altered, we do allow re-sits to aim for higher grades in practice and can make the procedure part of our study guide.  4.4: Regarding the definition of fraud, we agree with the suggested changes. However, we are not permitted to modify the wording in this section. We will consider this feedback for future TER formats, and we will make this known to the educational department.  5.4: Kiki had comments on the cum laude requirements. Students qualify for cum laude if:  The weighted average final mark of their test results for all courses is at least 8.0 (not rounded up), and the weighted average of the marks in words is at least ‘good’. The weighted average final mark for each of the following courses, including the final assessment, is a minimum of 9.0 (not rounded up) and/or ‘excellent’.  For summa cum laude:  The weighted average final mark of the test results for all courses is at least 9.0 and ‘excellent’ (not rounded up). Students have passed the final assessment with a mark of at least 9.0 (not rounded up) or ‘excellent’.  This document is still in editing, so multiple options are visible. I hope this clarifies the rules. We are always willing to discuss the TER during a meeting.  Thank you once again for your valuable feedback.  Sincerely,  2.6 make it part of the study guide, communicate!  3.6 formative grades should be standardized (meaning each student should receive a numerical grade or the Novice/competence/.... but ALL students should receive it in the assessment)  should they be partial tests?  4.1 make it part of the study guide, communicate!  4.4 this should be discussed with the educational department but we need to have clear rules for the HvA as well  5.4 if you receive all Visionary on all indicators you still recevied a 9.0, so the 9.0 is not reasonable a requirement for summa cum laude (impossible to reach). Similarly, the 8.0 is not reasonable for cum laude.  So either the number need to drop or the matrix needs to be adjusted.
