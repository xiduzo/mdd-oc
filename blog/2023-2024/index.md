## Introduction

This year we saw the normalization for the use of AI in the workplace. Although the Master Digital Design (MDD) embraces new technologies, as reflected last year, we are aware that we should remain critical in its' use. Concerns were raised from the teaching staff as there was a significant increase in LLM generated text in student documents submitted for assessments.

The MDD started an open discussion with this years' cohort on what are the expectations and how can we, together, use AI in a responsible matter. We hope to continue this discussion with the next cohort.

## Composition and appointment of the program committee

The two student representatives have been selected by the whole cohort during an in-class election. Out of 4 candidates, 2 students were selected by popular vote.

It is important to note that, due to unfortunate planning of the chair, this years advice report has not been reviewd by the student members.

As will be mentioned in the intentions for upcoming academic year, the OC is striving to become a more mature body within the MDD.

## Consent rights of the OC regarding the Teaching and Examination Regulations for master’s degree programme

**2.2 Exit qualifications/academic achievements**

_the qualities in the field of knowledge, insight and skills that a student must have acquired upon completion of the study programme_

\-

**2.3 Structure of curriculum**

_with regard to which master's programs application has been made to Article 7.4a, paragraph eight (size greater than 60 EC)_

N/A

**2.3 Structure of curriculum**

_the way in which the education in the relevant study program is evaluated._

\-

**3.4 Structure of curriculum**

_where necessary, the organization of practical exercises_

The `dojos` and `masterclasses` provided during the year were received as very useful. The OC would like to note that it would be beneficial to the program to structure these events more so that students can plan around this.

**8.1/8.1 Test overview**

_the content of the specializations within a study programme_

\-

_the study load of the program and of each of its parts constituting units of study_

\-

## Recommendations from the OC regarding articles where the Participation Council has consent rights

**2.3 Structure of curriculum**

_the full-time, part-time or dual structure of the study programme_

N/A

**2.4 Education format**

_the actual design of education_

Reflecting on the `Foundations` weeks, the OC noted that this took a significant chunk of the academic year. While they are perceived as useful, which differs per foundation/student, it would be good to reconsider the foundation-weeks.

The OC proposed to the staff to think about a way in which foundations could be given in parallel to both reduce the time-period on which they need to take place as well as the option for students to pick foundations they would like to take part in (e.g. not taking part in a typography foundation with a background as a professional UI designer)

**3.2/3.2 Number of attempts Sequential order**

_the number and sequence of the examinations as well as the times at which they can be taken_

\-

**3.2 Sequential order**

_where necessary, that passing exams is a condition for admission to other courses exams_

> This advice goes for what goes on beyond the HvA

Since the introduction of the `no grades` system in the MDD concerns have been raised for potential further positions beyond the program. Some positions require a specific GPA.

While the MDD provides a translation table from `no grade` to `grade` when required, it is impossible to even reach a _summa cum laude_. Only when receiving the max "grade" (`Visionary`) on all indicators, which is highly unlikely, you are eligible to receive this distinction on your diploma.

Similarly for _cum laude_, reaching a 8.0, is a near-impossible achievement.

The advice from the OC is to (re-)adjust the translation matrix to make it possible for students to graduate with distinction.

**3.4 Practical components**

_where necessary, the obligation to participate in practical exercises with a view to being admitted to the examination concerned, subject to the authority of the to grant an exemption from that obligation to the examination board, whether or not subject to substitute requirements_

N/A

**3.11/8.3 Validity**

_where necessary, the period of validity of successfully passed
examinations, subject to the authority of the Examination Board to extend that period of validity_

N/A

**8.1/8.2 Test overview**

_where necessary, the order in which, the periods in which and the
number of times per academic year that the opportunity is offered to take the interim and final examinations_

\-

_whether the interim examinations are taken orally, in writing or in another way, subject to the authority of the Examination Board in special cases to determine otherwise_

While most students were afraid of the high-stakes assessment moments, the `mock assessment` the MDD held with Sjoerd Simmerman (last years student & OC member) provided much clarity on what to expect.

## Additional remarks (advice) per chapter of the TER

**Teaching**

The MDD staff has been lacking clear communication over the course of the past year. This resulted in students not knowing what was going on in the program and made it hard to plan accordingly.

While efforts were made during the year to provide a planning at least a week ahead, the OC thinks this is a big area of improvement for coming academic years.

**Tests and partial test**

The MDD makes a distinction between `formative` and `summative` assessments. While the latter is the official moment to received a grade the OC advices the MDD to give an indication on where the student stands in the formative assessment besides the provided written feedback.

**Rules for sitting tests and partial tests**

\-

**Examination Board and Appeals Board**

\-

**Validity of Teaching and Examinations Regulations**

\-

**Test overview**

## Intentions for upcoming academic year

While we are a small program and the OC is in continuous rotation of its' members we would like to give the OC more structure and shape.

By providing a more mature OC we can be a stronger voice for the students and help guide the future growth MDD, respecting the needs of the program as well as those of the (future) students.
