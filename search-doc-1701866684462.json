Students, especially those from abroad, rely on accurate information to decide whether or not to apply for the MDD.  Things pointed out by students:  The foundations week took longer than promoted (2 months instead of 1)Not all students will be working directly with the partner agencies, it depends on the briefs provided in the playgrounds Some students explicitly apply to this program to have the opportunity to work with partner agencies and create a network within the Netherlands after the program.  Scheduling​  The MDD is a full-time program and students are expected to be available during the day. However, some students have part-time jobs or other obligations that require them to be available at certain times.  Having a fixed schedule for the MDD is not always possible, but the MDD should try to make more effort into scheduling the program as much in advance as possible so students can plan ahead. Advice for the current year is to schedule the program at least 1 month (4 school weeks) in advance. For the next year, the MDD should have a more clear schedule for the entire year students can rely upon.  Action point Discuss with the teaching staff how we can make sure the schedule is more clear and in advance for the students.  Pass-fail vs numerical grading​  Having a pass-fail system can potentially be a problem for students who want to continue into highly demanding environments after the master's program, and apply to a PhD program or a scholarship. This is because the pass-fail system does not provide a GPA, which is often a requirement for these programs.  Besides the future, some students are afraid that within a pass-fail system, the feedback they will receive won't be explicit enough on where they stand and how they can improve to achieve higher outcomes (read; better grades in a more traditional system).  As a final point, the range in the pass-fail system gives the students not enough feedback on &quot;how much&quot; they passed an assessment as a passing grade represents 50% of the spectrum.  Action point Discuss with the program director how we can make sure students can get a numerical grade instead of or besides a pass-fail grade.  Mentoring/preparation for the assessment(s)​  The Excel sheet provided to the students is not clearly explained and perceived, on top of this the students notice that each mentor is using the Excel sheet differently. This makes it hard for the students to prepare for the assessment(s) and they are not sure what to expect.  Students have also noticed they are getting contradicting advice from different mentors, especially on the personal project. This different advice would make sense in a 1-on-1 mentor session but this advice was given in a group setting.  The students are still unclear on how they will be assessed on the competencies and how they can prepare for this inside of their annotated portfolio. The shared competencies document (on the miro board) was shared as a draft over two months ago and has not been updated since.  Action point Try and arrange a mock assessment with the mentors and students to see how the assessment(s) will be conducted and what the students can expect.  DOJOs​  DOJOs are a good tool for students to explore new topics and learn from each other. However, as mentioned in scheduling, we need to make sure that the DOJOs are scheduled more in advance so students can have a fair chance to fit them into their schedules and attend them.  Students are in control of the DOJOS and if they can not attend a particular DOJO for whatever reason (eg, no more space in the DOJO or did not fit their schedule), they can always propose a new date and time.  One suggested DOJO from the students is UX design research. Questions the students have are:  what kind of jobs can I get with thishow does the day of a UX researcher look like  tip The MDD is stimulating students who have taken the DOJO to pass on their knowledge to the rest of the cohort (SDL!).  Action point Share more about the goal of the DOJOs to the students  Action point Arrange a DOJO on UX design research with a talk from a partner agency  Playgrounds​  The students have chosen to be in either one of the three playgrounds. However, the choice of playground was a bit ambiguous as the students did not have the feeling they had enough information to make a well-informed decision.  This was mostly due to the fact the students would have liked to have known the briefs for the playground ahead of time so they would have a better understanding of what they would be working on.  This, again, ties into the scheduling issue.

The Dutch government announced changes to the management of international students and new financial regulations to the admissions process were added. As a result, international students were somewhat less than in previous years.  In 2022, MDD welcomed new leadership to the program, injecting fresh ideas and perspectives. With renewed direction and enthusiasm, this year was a year of restructuring and trying out new ideas for the curriculum, such as the introduction of a project ‘Afterlife’. These changes were met with challenges due to understaffing, but nevertheless the staff did their best to navigate these hurdles.  New AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, took the world by storm. These new technologies opened new avenues for teaching, research and writing, and we welcomed ways these new technologies could be used by both students and teachers.

All given feedback was discussed prehend and handed to the writers of the MDD OER.  Examples of subjects on which the program committee can advise innovations in education; the self-reflection drawn up by the program during an accreditation or midterm; the way in which education is evaluated; etc.  Students have expressed comments that written reflections are not the best way to assess their work as designers. We wanted to ideate on how to better assess students during midterm and finals but were limited by school regulations. We also suggested better planning ahead for classes and other logistics, as students felt that announcements were last minute or not planned properly. For example, final assessment dates were announced about 3 weeks in advance.  Indicate whether, in the opinion of the program committee, the advice is generally taken seriously.  As mentioned before, during meetings with the writers of the OER we felt open to discussing our feedback on the form. However, after this year we do not see some parts adjusted the way we envisioned it. We believe this is mostly because of a lack of time on the writing side, which they expressed during our meeting.

As students we were asked to give feedback on the method of assessment and parts about where classes do fit in the year. As the OC we believe it would help to present a written document about the following year to show the results of these discussions. To get more out of the OC we would have liked to attend discussions about the plans for next year. This includes early setup of a new OC since the master is only one year and they have to find new participants every year.  We also believe that OC orientated forms are made in Dutch which is difficult to work with since our education is international. We believe the HvA should be more inclusive in this way.  Explanation  The HvA attaches great importance to the proper functioning of the program committee. On the basis of the annual report, the program committee briefly describes its activities in the past academic year and offers pointers for the OC in the coming academic year.  The annual report is presented to the program manager, the dean and the Faculty Council. The annual report of the program committee must be submitted by October 1.  The annual report of the OC must be published on the program's website.
