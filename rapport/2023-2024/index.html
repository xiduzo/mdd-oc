<p>The OC started to become more transparent in what they do and how they do it. We hope this will give the students a better understanding and trust in the way the members represent them.</p>
<p>This year we saw the normalization for the use of AI in the workplace. Although the Master Digital Design (MDD) embraces new technologies, as reflected last year, we are aware that we should remain critical in its&#x27; use. Concerns were raised from the teaching staff as there was a significant increase in LLM generated text in student documents submitted for assessments.</p>
<p>The MDD started an open discussion with this years&#x27; cohort on what are the expectations and how can we, together, use AI in a responsible matter. We hope to continue this discussion with the next cohort.</p>

<p>It is important to note that, due to unfortunate planning of the chair, this years advice report has not been reviewd by the student members.</p>
<p>As will be mentioned in the intentions for upcoming academic year, the OC is striving to become a more mature body within the MDD.</p>

<p><strong>Describe - briefly and in summary - the main points of the opinion on the OER.</strong></p>
<p>Since the introduction of the <code>no grades</code> system in the MDD concerns have been raised for potential further positions beyond the program. Some positions require a specific GPA. While the MDD provides a translation table from <code>no grade</code> to <code>grade</code> when required, it is impossible to even reach a <em>summa cum laude</em>. Only when receiving the max &quot;grade&quot; (<code>Visionary</code>) on all indicators, which is highly unlikely, you are eligible to receive this distinction on your diploma. Similarly for <em>cum laude</em>, reaching a 8.0, is a near-impossible achievement. The advice from the OC is to (re-)adjust the translation matrix to make it possible for students to graduate with distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Indicate whether, in the opinion of the program committee, its recommendations on the OER are generally taken seriously.</strong></p>
<p>Although most concerns were taken seriously, the limitations on changing the OER was noted by the OC. One of the biggest concerns for this years OC was the sudden change of hearts into a <code>no grades</code> system while the details of this needs to be worked out more before it could be generally accepted to work in the benefit of the students.</p>

<p><strong>Describe what the program committee thinks about the realization of the plans: in the opinion of the program committee, have the plans been realized to a sufficient degree or not?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Describe - briefly and in summary - the main points of the other advice (i.e., not about the OER and the spending of SVM) issued by the program committees.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>dojos</code> and <code>masterclasses</code> provided during the year were received as very useful. The OC would like to note that it would be beneficial to the program to structure these events more so that students can plan around this.</li>
<li>Reflecting on the <code>Foundations</code> weeks, the OC noted that this took a significant chunk of the academic year. While they are perceived as useful, which differs per foundation/student, it would be good to reconsider the foundation-weeks. The OC proposed to the staff to think about a way in which foundations could be given in parallel to both reduce the time-period on which they need to take place as well as the option for students to pick foundations they would like to take part in (e.g. not taking part in a typography foundation with a background as a professional UI designer)</li>
<li>The MDD staff has been lacking clear communication over the course of the past year. This resulted in students not knowing what was going on in the program and made it hard to plan accordingly. While efforts were made during the year to provide a planning at least a week ahead, the OC thinks this is a big area of improvement for coming academic years.</li>
<li>The MDD makes a distinction between formative and summative assessments. While the latter is the official moment to received a grade the OC advices the MDD to give an indication on where the student stands in the formative assessment besides the provided written feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of subjects on which the program committee can advise innovations in education; the self-reflection drawn up by the program during an accreditation or midterm; the way in which education is evaluated; etc.</strong></p>
<p>The OC feels like it can help steer/guide the conversation on the use of AI/LLM technology in the work of the students. What is unclear as of now is how the MDD will uphold the rules and regulations of the HvA when it comes to the use of AI/LLM technology in the work of the students where it is also promoted to experiment with new technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Indicate whether, in the opinion of the program committee, the advice is generally taken seriously.</strong></p>
<p>Although most concerns were taken seriously, the limitations on changing the OER was noted by the OC. One of the biggest concerns for this years OC was the sudden change of hearts into a <code>no grades</code> system while the details of this needs to be worked out more before it could be generally accepted to work in the benefit of the students.</p>

<p>While we are a small program and the OC is in continuous rotation of its&#x27; members we would like to give the OC more structure and shape.</p>
<p>By providing a more mature OC we can be a stronger voice for the students and help guide the future growth MDD, respecting the needs of the program as well as those of the (future) students.</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-blog-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/xiduzo/mdd-oc/tree/main/blog/2023-2024/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_JAkA"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/mdd-oc/rapport/2022-2023"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">MDD advice rapport 2022-2023</div></a></nav></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#introduction" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="#composition-and-appointment-of-the-program-committee" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Composition and appointment of the program committee</a></li><li><a href="#education-committee" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Education committee</a></li><li><a href="#facilitate-program-committee-and-testing-committee" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Facilitate program committee and testing committee</a></li><li><a href="#evaluation-on-the-education-and-examination-regulations-oer" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Evaluation on the Education and Examination Regulations (OER)</a></li><li><a href="#evaluation-on-the-use-of-study-advance-funds-svm" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Evaluation on the use of study advance funds (SVM)</a></li><li><a href="#advice-and-evaluation-on-advice-to-management" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Advice and evaluation on advice to management</a></li><li><a href="#intentions-for-upcoming-academic-year" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Intentions for upcoming academic year</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2024 MDD OC, Built with Docusaurus.</div></div></div></footer></div>
