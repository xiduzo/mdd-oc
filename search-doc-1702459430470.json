The Dutch government announced changes to the management of international students and new financial regulations to the admissions process were added. As a result, international students were somewhat less than in previous years.  In 2022, MDD welcomed new leadership to the program, injecting fresh ideas and perspectives. With renewed direction and enthusiasm, this year was a year of restructuring and trying out new ideas for the curriculum, such as the introduction of a project ‘Afterlife’. These changes were met with challenges due to understaffing, but nevertheless the staff did their best to navigate these hurdles.  New AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, took the world by storm. These new technologies opened new avenues for teaching, research and writing, and we welcomed ways these new technologies could be used by both students and teachers.

All given feedback was discussed prehend and handed to the writers of the MDD OER.  Examples of subjects on which the program committee can advise innovations in education; the self-reflection drawn up by the program during an accreditation or midterm; the way in which education is evaluated; etc.  Students have expressed comments that written reflections are not the best way to assess their work as designers. We wanted to ideate on how to better assess students during midterm and finals but were limited by school regulations. We also suggested better planning ahead for classes and other logistics, as students felt that announcements were last minute or not planned properly. For example, final assessment dates were announced about 3 weeks in advance.  Indicate whether, in the opinion of the program committee, the advice is generally taken seriously.  As mentioned before, during meetings with the writers of the OER we felt open to discussing our feedback on the form. However, after this year we do not see some parts adjusted the way we envisioned it. We believe this is mostly because of a lack of time on the writing side, which they expressed during our meeting.

As students we were asked to give feedback on the method of assessment and parts about where classes do fit in the year. As the OC we believe it would help to present a written document about the following year to show the results of these discussions. To get more out of the OC we would have liked to attend discussions about the plans for next year. This includes early setup of a new OC since the master is only one year and they have to find new participants every year.  We also believe that OC orientated forms are made in Dutch which is difficult to work with since our education is international. We believe the HvA should be more inclusive in this way.  Explanation  The HvA attaches great importance to the proper functioning of the program committee. On the basis of the annual report, the program committee briefly describes its activities in the past academic year and offers pointers for the OC in the coming academic year.  The annual report is presented to the program manager, the dean and the Faculty Council. The annual report of the program committee must be submitted by October 1.  The annual report of the OC must be published on the program's website.

Student input The students responded by providing some feedback on the DOJOs and made: Dojos and sessions requests  The document provided is lacking some direction and is not very clear on what the students want to learn:  Some DOJOs are way too broad (e.g; UX design) in scope and can be a full 2 year program by itself. As from the message put in teams: &quot;learning to code&quot; is a very broad topic, what do you want to learn? This can range from building apps, making websites, interactive art/installations, writing a Figma plugin, automating my house, working with open data, making prototypes interactiveSome DOJOs are random buzz words (e.g; Video Coaching) and lack focus on what the students want to learn. As from the message put in teams: What is important for a DOJO is to have a clear goal you want to learnSome DOJOs are already out there on brightspace and can be followed by the students themselves. Master students are expected to be pro-active in their learning process.Some DOJOs can be done by other facilities within the HvA. For example; the HvA has a 3D printing facility (the makers lab) where students can learn about 3D printing by the staff present.Some DOJOs are part of the curriculum and will be provided by the teaching staff. For example; User Research is part of the track angela is teaching.  Other DOJOs will be planned according to the document provided by the students. This document is shared among the teaching staff. The MDD will also reach out the partner agencies to see if they can provide a DOJO/workshop.  SDL Due to time constraints we will not be able to provide all requested DOJOs. The MDD is stimulating students who also are pro-active in learning about the topics they are interested in. This is a great opportunity for students to take the lead and organize a DOJO themselves.

This is because the pass-fail system does not provide a GPA, which is often a requirement for these programs.  Besides the future, some students are afraid that within a pass-fail system, the feedback they will receive won't be explicit enough on where they stand and how they can improve to achieve higher outcomes (read; better grades in a more traditional system).  As a final point, the range in the pass-fail system gives the students not enough feedback on &quot;how much&quot; they passed an assessment as a passing grade represents 50% of the spectrum.
